"AWM - Irrigation Disposal of Wastewater"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Irrigation Disposal of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Irrigation Disposal of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The wastewater considered in this guide is municipal wastewater and wastewater from food processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater contains domestic waste and, in some areas, includes industrial waste.  It may be untreated, although this is rare, or wastewater may have received primary or secondary treatment.  Food processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it has a high content of sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluent, as discussed in this guide, refer to the effluent from facilities used to treat or store domestic wastes, wastewater from food processing, or liquid animal wastes.  The effluent from a municipal or food processing plant lagoon or storage pond commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  The effluent from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds have much higher concentrations of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is from 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  Ratings are based on the influence of existing soil properties on the use.

Scope: National

Some wastewater may cause an increase in sodicity or salinity in the soils in arid and semiarid regions but it generally does not in humid regions.  The heavy metal contents of effluents are usually low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

The soil properties and qualities need to be considered in the design, construction, management, and performance of wastewater irrigation systems.  The soil properties and qualities important in design and management are the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a seasonal high water table, the available water capacity, permeability, wind erodibility, erosion factor, slope, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence construction are stones, depth to bedrock or cemented pan, and depth to a seasonal high water table.  The properties and qualities that affect performance of the irrigation system are depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, bulk density, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and soil reaction.  The cation exchange capacity also affects performance, and it is used here as an estimate of the capacity of a soil to adsorb heavy metals.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to irrigation.

The soil rating guide is based on the utilization of the water for crop production and is not directed toward only the disposal or treatment of the wastewater.  Checks should be made to ensure that heavy metals, nitrogen, and other salts are not added in excessive amounts.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.

Description:

Municipal sewage sludge is the residual product of the treatment of municipal sewage.  The solid component is composed mainly of cell mass, primarily bacteria cells which have developed during secondary treatment and which have incorporated soluble organic into their own bodies.  Sludge also contains small amounts of sand, silt, and other solid debris.

The water content of sludge ranges from about 98 percent to about 40 percent or less.  The sludge is called liquid if it is more than about 90 percent water, slurry if it is about 90 to 50 percent water, and solid if it is less than about 50 percent water.  Depending on the water content, the sludge can be moved by pump, conveyor, or auger.

Municipal sewage sludges have a variable nitrogen content.  Some sludge contains constituents that are toxic to plant growth or hazardous to the food chain (such as heavy metals or exotic organic compounds) and should be chemically analyzed prior to use.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the waste for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of slurry sludge can be by tank wagon or by irrigation equipment that is modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry sludges can be made at the surface or subsurface.

The soil properties and qualities considered in the ratings are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of application.  Soil properties and qualities that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density.  They also affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope and the susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for water erosion.  Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

"AWM - Manure and Food Processing Waste"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry.  The consistency of manure is labile.  It changes in storage or treatment, and it depends upon the bedding used and upon whether the manure is diluted or allowed to dry.  Food processing wastes consist of damaged fruit and vegetables and the peelings, stems, leaves, pits, and soil particles removed in food preparation.  Most wastes produced in the processing of milk, cheese, and meat are liquids.  Paunch manure is an exception.

Manure and food processing wastes have variable nitrogen content.  The material is solid, slurry, or liquid.  A high nitrogen content limits the application rate.  Toxic or otherwise dangerous wastes, such as those mixed with the lye used in food processing, are outside the meaning of manure and food processing wastes as used in this interpretation.

Scope: National

The soil rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the wastes for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of liquid wastes can be made by tank wagon or conventional irrigation methods that are modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry wastes can be made at the surface or subsurface.

This interpretive rule uses the criteria published in the AGRICULTURAL WASTE MANAGEMENT FIELD HANDBOOK (Part 651), Engineering Division, Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA.

Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of the application of wastes.  Soil properties that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, sodium adsorption ratio, the depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and the available water capacity.  Soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  The wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slopes, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind and water erosion. Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals and other potential pollutants found in agricultural waste and sustaining vigorous plant growth.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The wastewater considered is from municipal wastewater, food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, raw sewage (untreated), or it may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a lagoon or storage pond that is used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic wastes are very dilute, and the effluent from a facility that treats them commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons and storage ponds that treat animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

In this process, wastewater is applied to the upper reaches of sloped land and allowed to flow across vegetated surfaces that are sometimes called terraces, to runoff collection ditches.  The length of the run generally is 150 to 300 feet.  Application rates range from 2.5 to 16.0 inches per week.  The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients to plants and soil surfaces as it flows downslope in a thin film.  Most of the water reaches the collection ditch, some is lost by evapotranspiration, and a small part percolates to the ground water.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  However, areas are vegetated because plants are a necessary part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Wastewater generally is applied by sprinkler or surface application methods.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, and the design and construction of site.  The properties that affect adsorption are soil reaction and the cation exchange capacity.  Soil reaction, salinity, and the sodium adsorption ratio are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope, permeability within a depth of about 30 inches, depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and stones are soil properties and qualities that influence design and construction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

"AWM - Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process, the wastewater is applied in a level basin and percolates through the soil.  The treated water eventually reaches the ground water.  Application rates range from 4 to 120 inches per week.

The wastewater considered generally is from municipal wastewater treatment plants.  The nitrogen content generally is low.  Normally, the heavy metal content is low; however, chemical analysis should be made prior to use.  Because the thickness of soil material needed for proper renovation of the wastewater is more than 72 inches, geologic and hydrologic investigations during the planning stages.  This information is needed to ensure proper design and to determine reliability of performance as well as the potential for pollution of the ground water.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment design or process but the basin may be vegetated.

The soil properties and qualities that influence risk of pollution, design and construction, and performance are major considerations.  Depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, and depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan present potential hazards and influence design and construction.  Slope and stones are also important considerations in design and construction.  The properties and qualities that influence performance are permeability and soil reaction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process wastewater is applied to the land at a rate normally between 0.5 and 4.0 inches per week.  The primary purpose is wastewater treatment rather than irrigation of crops.  Application rates commonly exceed those needed for supplemental irrigation for crop production.  The applied wastewater is treated as it moves through the soil.  Much of the treated water percolates to the ground water and some enter the atmosphere by evapotranspiration.  Surface runoff of the applied water generally is not allowed.  Water-logging is avoided either through control of the application rate or the use of tile drains, or both.

The wastewater considered includes municipal wastewater and effluent from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, untreated sewage or may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a facility used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons or storage ponds for animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment design or process but the basin may be vegetated.  However, it is assumed that crops are grown or may be grown as a part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Checks should be made to ensure that heavy metals and nitrogen are not added in excessive amounts.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the application of wastes.  Properties and qualities that affect absorption are the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a seasonal high water table, the available water capacity, permeability, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, soil reaction, cation exchange capacity, and slope.  Soil reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slope, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind erosion and water erosion.  Stones can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

"ENG - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (~79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated pit.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit.  When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Pit operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

"ENG - Construction Materials; Gravel Source"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a "" Gravel Source"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soils potential as a source of gravel.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then desirable source of gravel.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the "" Gravel Source"" interpretive rule.  

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Gravel as a construction material is defined as particles ranging in size from 4.76 mm (sieve #4) to 76 mm (3 inches) in diameter.  Gravel is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the gravel for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of gravel.  The soil interpretation for gravel source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a probable source of gravel are grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the gravel layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains gravel, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the gravel layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Bottom layer: If the bottom layer contains significant amounts of material that passes the #4 sieve and not the #200 sieve, and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the bottom layer is a potential source for sand.  The bottom layer takes precedence over the thickest layer.   There is no layer thickness restriction on the bottom layer.  The following child rules are joined by the AND operator and the one with the lowest index number determine the interpretive result.

Child rules used:

	Percent Passing the #4 Sieve (Bottom Layer) -- Gravelly: Soil with a gravelly bottom layer is a source of gravel.  Soil feature considered is percent passing the #4 sieve of the bottom layer or the last layer above bedrock.
	
	Property used: PASSING # 4 SIEVE BOTTOM LAYER (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		>= 50
		Somewhat limiting 	 > 10 and < 50
		Not limiting		<= 10
		
	Null sieves are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
AND	
	
	Coarse Fragments 3 to 10 inch (Bottom Layer) -- Cobble content: Excessive cobbles (rock fragments, 3 to 10 inches in size) in the bottom layer limits the layers potential as a source of commercial gravel by reducing the volume of available gravel.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in size in the bottom soil layer and above bedrock.

	Null 3 to 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Limiting class.
		
AND

	Coarse Fragments > 10 inch (Bottom Layer) -- Stone content: Excessive stones (rock fragments > 10 inches in size) in the bottom layer limits the layers potential as a source of commercial gravel by reducing the volume of available gravel.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight rock fragments greater then 10 inches in size in the bottom soil layer and above bedrock.

	Property used: FRAGMENTS > 250mm BOTTOM LAYER (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		>= 35%
		Somewhat limiting	> 0% to < 35%
		Not limiting		= 0%
		
	Null > 10-inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Limiting class.
	
	2.  Thickest layer: If the thickest layer contains significant amounts of material that does not passes the #4 sieve and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the thickest layer is a potential source for gravel.  The bottom layer takes precedence over the thickest layer.  The following child rules are joined by the AND operator and the one with the lowest index number determine the interpretive result.

Child rules used:

	Layer Thickness -- Thin layer: The thickest soil layer is derived from layer depth to evaluate the potential quantity of sand or gravel available as a commercial source.  The thinner the layer the less potential.  Soil feature considered is layer thickness above a cemented restrictive feature.

	Property used: PASSING # 4 SIEVE THICKEST LAYER and NOT BOTTOM. (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		>= 50

AND	
	
	Coarse Fragments 3 to 10 inch (Thickest Layer) -- Cobble content: Excessive cobbles (rock fragments, 3 to 10 inches in size) in the thickest layer limits the layer's potential as a source of commercial gravel by reducing the volume of available gravel.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in size in the thickest soil layer within depth of 0 to 72"" (0 to 180cm) or to a restrictive layer.

		Not limiting		= 0%
		
	Null 3 to 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not rated class.
		
AND

	Coarse Fragments > 10 inch (Thickest Layer) -- Stone content: Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in size) in the thickest layer limits the layer's potential as a source of commercial gravel by reducing the volume of available gravel.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight coarse fragments > 10 inches in size in the thickest soil layer within depth of 0 to 72"" (0 to 180cm) or to a restrictive layer.

Description:

Soil reconstruction of areas drastically disturbed, as in surface mining, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

Most new state strip mine programs emphasize that the land surface be restored to about its natural configuration or better and that the soil be reconstructed to maintain or improve its suitability for the intended use.  Thus, knowledge of the soil and underlying material is needed to plan proper reconstruction operations of mined land.  This guide for soil reconstruction material evaluates the material as a medium for plant growth.  This guide does not cover areas of quarry, pit, dredge, and older surface mine operations that require an offsite source of soil reconstruction material.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Too clayey: Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  Soil feature considered is the maximum percent clay to a depth of 100cm or above a cemented restrictive feature.

	Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	2.  Cobble content: Excessive cobbles (rock fragments, 3 to 10 inches in size) in the upper 72 inches (180 cm) of the soil can interfere with construction equipment.  Soil feature considered is percent weighted average by weight coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in size in the upper 72 inches of soil or above a restrictive layer.

		Not limiting		<= 25%
		
	Null 3 to 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	3.  Water erosion: Soils with high K factors have a tendency to erode and when used as reclamation materials are subject to water erosion.  Water erosion preventative practices are recommended on soils with high K factors.  Soil feature considered is the maximum K factor (whole) within a depth of 40 inches.

		Not limiting		=< 15 %
				
	Null CaCO3 values are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	5.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio have the potential to restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 20"" (0-50 cm).

"ENG - Construction Materials; Roadfill"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Roadfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of roadfill.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of roadfill.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Roadfill"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Roadfill consists of soil material that is excavated from its original position and used in road embankments elsewhere.  The evaluations for roadfill are for low embankments that generally are less than 6 feet in height and are less exacting in design than high embankments, such as those along superhighways.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  In Table 620-7 criteria, limits, and restrictive features for rating soils for local roads and streets are given.  Soils are rated as to the amount of material available for excavation, the ease of excavation, and how well the material performs after it is in place.

Scope: National

Soil properties that affect the amount of material available for excavation are thickness of suitable material above bedrock or other material that is not suitable.  The percent of coarse fragments more than 3 inches in diameter, the depth to a seasonal high water table, and the slope are properties that influence the ease of excavation.  How well the soil performs in place is indicated by the AASHTO classification and group index and by the shrink-swell potential.  A high content of gypsum can cause piping or pitting.  Some damage to the borrow area is expected; but if revegetation and erosion control are likely to be difficult, the soil is rated severe.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Cobble content: Excessive cobbles (rock fragments, 3 to 10 inches in size) in the upper 40 inches (100 cm) of the soil can interfere with construction equipment and grade stabilization.  Soil feature considered is percent weighted average by weight coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in size in the upper 40 inches of soil.

	Null 3 to 10 inch rock fragments are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	2.  Shrink-swell: Excessive shrink-swell (weighted average) between 25 and 150cm deep can cause roads to shift and paving to crack.  Soil feature considered is weighted average percent linear extensibility between a depth of 10 to 60 inches or above bedrock.

	Property used: SHRINK-SWELL 25-150cm OR ABOVE Restrictive Layer Wt_Ave. (Modality - high, low, and representative value)

		Not limiting		<= 5%
		
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	5.  Low strength: Soils with high AASHTO Group Index have low strength which affects the soil's traffic-supporting capacity and reduces the soil's potential as a site for roadfill.  This condition is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic.  Soil feature considered is the AASHTO Group Index of the thickest soil layer below 25cm or to a cemented restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sand as a construction material is usually defined as particles ranging in size from 0.074 mm (sieve #200) to 4.75 mm (sieve #4) in diameter.  Sand is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the sand for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of sand.  The soil interpretation for sand source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soils as a probable source of sand are the grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the sand layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  They are listed in Table 620-8.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt is high in organic materials and not a good source of construction materials.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of all soil layers.

The following child rules are joined by the AND operator and the one with the lowest index number determine the interpretive result.

Child rules used:

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The term ""topsoil"" has several meanings.  As used here, the term describes soil material used to cover an area and improve soil conditions for the establishment and maintenance of adapted vegetation. 

Generally, the upper part of the soil, which is richest in organic matter, is most desirable for use as topsoil; however, material excavated from deeper layers is also used.  In this rating, the upper 40 inches of soil material is evaluated for use as topsoil.  In the borrow area, the material below 40 inches is evaluated for its suitability for plant growth after the upper 40 inches is removed.

Scope: National

Soil properties that are used to rate the soil as topsoil are those that affect plant growth; the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading; and the reclamation of the borrow area.

The physical and chemical soil properties and qualities that influence plant growth are the presence of toxic substances, soil reaction, and those properties that are inferred from the soil texture, such as the available water capacity and fertility.  The properties that influence the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading are the amount of rock fragments, slope, depth to the water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material.  The properties that influence the reclamation of the borrow area are the slope, depth to the water table, amount of rock fragments, depth to rock, and the presence of toxic material.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Carbonate content: Soils with high calcium carbonate content in the thickest layer may limit vegetative growth of some plant species. Soil feature considered is calcium carbonate equivalent of the thickest horizon that has any portion between depths 0"" to 40"" (0 to 100 cm) or above a restrictive layer.

		Not limiting		=< 15 %
				
	Null CaCO3 values are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	2.  Too Clayey: Clayey soils, low in organic matter, may become sticky when wet and have poor tilth.

"ENG - Daily Cover for Landfill"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Daily Cover for Landfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Daily Cover for Landfill"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is applied daily to compacted solid waste in a sanitary landfill.  The cover material is obtained offsite, transported, and spread on the area.  The required soil characteristics for both daily and final cover materials are similar enough to share one rating.

Scope: National

Soil interpretations for Daily Cover for Landfills are a tool for guiding the user in barrow site selection and has additional application for the reclamation of some quarries, pits, and surface mine operations.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.

Suitability of a soil for use as cover is based on properties that reflect workability and the ease of digging and of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during both wet and dry periods.  Soils that are loamy or silty and that are free of stones are better suited than other soils.  Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread, and sandy soils may be subject to soil blowing.  Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material.  It also may affect the final configuration of the borrow area and, thus, runoff, erosion, and reclamation.

The soils selected for daily cover for landfill should also be suitable for growing plants.  They should not contain significant amounts of substances that are toxic to plants, such as a high content of sodium, salts, or lime.  They should be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table so that material can be removed efficiently while leaving a borrow area that can be revegetated.  However, some damage to the borrow area is expected and plant growth may not be optimum.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for dwellings w/o basements are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities affecting the capacity of soil to support a load without movement and on those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties and qualities affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are the presence of a high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are a seasonal high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and the amount and size of rock fragments.

Description:

Soils are rated for their use in establishing and maintaining turf for lawns and golf fairways and ornamental trees and shrubs for residential or commercial landscaping.

Scope: National

Soil interpretations for lawn, landscape, or golf fairways are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.

"ENG - Local Roads and Streets"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Local Roads and Streets"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Local Roads and Streets"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Local roads and streets are those roads and streets that have all-weather surfacing (commonly of asphalt or concrete) and that are expected to carry automobile traffic year-round.

Scope: National

The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2)  the base material, which may be lime-stabilized soil, cement-stabilized soil, gravel, or crushed rock;
(3) the actual road surface or street pavement, which is either flexible (asphalt), rigid (concrete), or gravel with binder in it.
They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  With the probable exception of the hard surface, roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at hand.

Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index and the Unified classification, subsidence, shrink-swell behavior, potential frost action, and depth to the seasonal high water table.

"ENG - Sanitary Landfill (Area)"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (area) is a solid-waste disposal practice where successive layers of refuse are placed on the soil surface.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is imported from a source away from the site.  A final cover of soil at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill.   Properties and qualities that influence trafficability and risk of pollution are the important considerations for area sanitary landfills.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Flooding is a serious problem because of the risk of washouts and pollution downstream and the difficulty of moving trucks in and out of flooded areas.  Permeability of the soil is an important consideration in all but the most arid parts of the country.  If permeability is too rapid or if fractured bedrock or a fractured cemented pan is close to the surface, the risk of contaminating the water supply by leachate is great.  A high water table may also transmit pollutants to the water supply and is likely to restrict truck movement during wet seasons.  

Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads on sloping soils.  Furthermore, leachate may flow along the soil surface on sloping soils and cause difficult seepage problems in completed fills.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Flooding: Flooding has the potential to transport agricultural waste off site and pollute surface waters.  Flooding also limits building, recreational, and sanitary facility use and management of these soils.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (trench) is a method of disposing solid waste by placing refuse in successive layers in an excavated trench.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 5 or 6 feet).  However, because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the landfill developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the landfill.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a trench-type landfill operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the fill.

"ENG - Septic Tank Absorption Fields"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.  

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic tank absorption fields are subsurface systems of tile or perforated pipe that distribute effluent from a septic tank into the natural soil.  The centerline depth of the tile is assumed to be 24 inches or deeper.  Only the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is considered in making the ratings.  Soil properties and site features considered are those that affect the absorption of the effluent, those that affect the construction and maintenance of the system, and those that may affect public health.

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic Tank Absorption Field interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption of the effluent are permeability, depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding.  Stones and boulders and a shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interfere with installation.  Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.
 
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth less than 4 feet below the distribution lines.  In these soils, the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new; consequently, ground water supplies may be contaminated.
 
Percolation tests are used by some regulatory agencies to evaluate the suitability of a soil for septic tank absorption fields.  These tests should be performed during the season when the water table is highest and the soil is at minimum absorptive capacity.

"ENG - Sewage Lagoons"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sewage Lagoons"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sewage Lagoons"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the wastes.  Lagoons have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted, relatively impervious soil material.  Relatively impervious soil for the lagoon floor and sides is desirable to minimize seepage and contamination of local ground water.  

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent. Sewage lagoons interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of liquid effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil permeability is a critical property in evaluating a soil for sewage lagoons.  Most porous soils will eventually seal when being used for a sewage lagoon.  Until they do, however, the hazard of pollution is severe.  Soils that have a permeability rate that exceeds 2 inches per hour generally are too porous for the proper operation of sewage lagoons and may cause contamination.  Fractured bedrock within a depth of 40 inches may create a pollution hazard.  Bedrock and cemented pans create construction problems.

Slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make smoothing practical so that the lagoon is uniformly deep throughout.

If floodwater overtops the lagoon, it interferes with the functioning of the lagoon and carries away polluting sewage before sufficient decomposition has taken place.  Ordinarily, soils susceptible to flooding have a severe limitation for sewage lagoons.  If floodwater velocities are slow and flooding is rarely deep enough to overtop the lagoon embankment, the susceptibility to flooding does not constitute a severe limitation rating.

Soils that contain a large amount of organic matter are not suitable for the floor of an aerobic lagoon.  The organic matter promotes an anaerobic rather than aerobic environment.

Depth to water table is important if it influences the water level in the lagoon.  If it does, a pollution hazard exists.  Sometimes depth to water table is disregarded if the lagoon floor is of slowly permeable soil material that is at least 4 feet thick.  Soils that contain excess rock fragments greater than 3 inches are undesirable sites because the fragments interfere with the manipulation and compaction needed to prepare the lagoon floor.

"ENG - Shallow Excavations"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Shallow Excavations"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Shallow Excavations"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Shallow excavations are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for pipelines, sewer lines, telephone and power transmission lines, basements, open ditches, grave sites, etc.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for shallow excavations are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging and resistance to sloughing.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Too clayey: Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  Soil feature considered is the maximum percent clay between 50 and 180cm.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Small commercial buildings are those buildings that are less than three stories without basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete at a depth of 2 feet or at the depth of maximum frost penetration, whichever is deeper. 

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for small commercial buildings are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities affecting the capacity of the soil to support a load without movement and those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties and qualities affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are presence of a high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are flooding, a high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount and size of coarse fragments.

"URB/REC - Camp Areas"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Camp Areas"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Camp Areas"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Camp areas are tracts of land used intensively as sites for tents, trailers, campers, and the accompanying activities of outdoor living.  Camp areas require site preparation such as shaping and leveling in the areas used for tents and parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines.  Camp areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing camping areas and the performance of the camping area after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are important.  For tent or remote campsites, the limitations would be less restrictive.

Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or cemented pans are the main concerns in developing camp areas.  However, areas associated with picnic areas may have steep slopes and rough terrain for aesthetic purposes.  For good trafficability, the surface of camp areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, permeability, and presence of toxic materials.  Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous for camp areas because of the danger to life and property.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt is high in organic materials, has low strength, and is hard to reclaim.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of the surface layer if the layer is greater then 25cm thick.
	
	Property used: SURFACE LAYER THICKNESS nssc (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	 > 25cm
		Not limiting	<= 25cm

AND

	Property used: UNIFIED THICKEST LAYER 25-180cm (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""pt""
		Not limiting	not = ""pt""
		
	Null Unified classes are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	2.  Flooding: Soil that floods limit the installation and function for building site applications.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: FLOODING FREQUENCY (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""very rare"" or ""rare"" or ""occasional"" or ""frequent"" or ""very frequent""
		Not limiting		= ""none""
		
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	3.  Too Stony: Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in size) on the soil surface can interfere with equipment operations and are a nuisance for most landuses.  Soil feature considered is percent of the soil surface covered by rock fragments > 10 inches in size.

	Property used: FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON SURFACE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 3.0%
		Somewhat limiting	>=  .1% to <= 3.0%
		Not limiting		 <  .1%
		
	Null surface cover percentage of rock fragments with an rv >=250mm are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	4.  Content of large stones: Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 3 inch) in size in soil surface layer are nuisances and may impede maintenance.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight rock fragments > 3 inches in size in the surface soil layer.

	Property used: FRAGMENTS > 75mm SURFACE LAYER (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		   > 75%
		Somewhat limiting	 >=  25% to <= 75%
		Not limiting		  <  25%
		
	Null > 3 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	5.  Restricted permeability: The soil horizon with the minimum Ksat governs the rate of water movement through the whole soil.  When this rate is low, transmission of fluids into and through the soil impedes infiltration and percolation of percipitation and may cause water to pond and wet condition to presist for extended periods of time. Soil feature considered is the layer with the minimum saturated hydraulic conductivity within 100cm of the surface and above a restrictive layer.  If the soil is in taxonomic class TOR, UST, or XER SUBORDERS; TOR, UST, or XER GREAT GROUPS; TOR, UST, ARIDIC, or XER SUBGROUPS then the limiting condition is reduced by half.
	
	Property used: KSAT MINIMUM ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER (0-100cm) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	=< .4 micrometers/sec
		Somewhat Limiting 	 > .4 and < 4 micrometers/sec
		Not limiting		=> 4 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	6.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".

"URB/REC - Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Off-road motorcycle trails are primarily for recreational use.  Trails for other off-road vehicles may have similar criteria.  Little or no preparation is done to the trail, and the surface is not vegetated or surfaced.  Considerable compaction of the soil on the trail is expected.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing off-road motorcycle trails and the performance of off-road motorcycle trails after development.  Erodibility, revegetation, trafficability, and dustiness are the main concerns in developing paths and trails.  For good trafficability, the surface of a path or trail should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Considerations for desirable off-road challenges are not included.

Soil properties considered are stoniness, slope, wetness, texture of the surface layer, and flooding.  Slope affects the soil erodibility.  Large stones affect the configuration of the trail.  Small stones affect trafficability.  Wetness and flooding affect revegetation and frequency of use.  Surface texture affects erodibility, trafficability, revegetation, and probability of dust.

"URB/REC - Picnic Areas"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Picnic Areas"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Picnic Areas"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Picnic areas are natural or landscaped tracts used primarily for preparing meals and eating outdoors.  These areas are subject to heavy foot traffic.  Most vehicular traffic is confined to access roads and parking lots.  Soils ratings are based on properties that influence the development costs of shaping the site, trafficability, and the growth of vegetation after development.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing picnic areas and the performance of the picnic areas after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are important.

Slope and stoniness are the main concerns in developing picnic areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of picnic areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock, permeability, and the presence of toxic materials.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt is high in organic materials, has low strength, and is hard to reclaim.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of the surface layer if the layer is greater then 25cm thick.

"WMS - Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Embankments, dikes, and levees are raised structures of soil material that are constructed to impound water or protect land against overflow.  They generally are less than 20 feet high, are constructed of ""homogeneous"" soil material (without a core zone), and are compacted to medium density.  Embankments that have zoned construction (core and shell) are not considered.

Soil properties influence development of embankments, dikes, and levees including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for embankments, dikes, and levees are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Ratings are made for the soil that may be source of material for embankment fills.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  The ratings do not indicate the suitability of the undisturbed soil for supporting the embankment.  Soil properties to a depth greater than the embankment height have an effect on the performance and safety of the embankment.  Generally, deeper onsite geologic investigations must be made to determine these important properties.


Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.  Suitable sites may be difficult to find on slopes steeper than about 10 percent.

Embankments, dikes, and levees require soil material that is resistant to seepage, piping, and erosion and that has favorable compaction characteristics.  Organic soils are not suitable because of high compression, low strength, and unpredictable permeability.  When compacting with tamping rollers (sheepsfoot rollers) or pneumatic rollers, stones over 6 inches in size must be removed; therefore, stony soils are limited for this use.  If a water table is present, the depth of usable material and the trafficability are affected.

The content of sodium and salts affects the capability for plant growth on embankment surfaces.  These properties may also indicate dispersive soils that are highly erosive and susceptible to piping.  Soils that contain gypsum may have piping and uneven settling.

Low-density silts and clays in the supporting foundation generally have excessive settlement and low strength.  Loose soils in arid regions undergo much settlement very rapidly upon becoming saturated as water is impounded.  These soils generally do not provide adequate support for embankments.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Hard to pack: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with high plasticity and liquid limits are difficult to compact.  These hard to pact soil are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low compaction index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

An aquifer-fed excavated pond is a body of water created by excavating a pit or dugout into a ground-water aquifer.  Excluded are ponds that are fed by surface runoff and embankment ponds that impound water 3 feet or more above the original surface.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect aquifer-fed excavated ponds are depth to a permanent water table, permeability of the aquifer, and quality of water as determined by inference from the salinity of the soil.  Large stones are also considered because of their effect on the ease of excavation.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Cutbanks cave: Soils with high water table are suited for aquifer-fed ponds.  However, cutbanks may cave or slump during excavation of the pond reservoir and pose a safety concern when the soil texture is silt or texture group is sandy or texture modifier is sandy or gravelly.  This tendency is true for all soils but to a lesser degree and the interpretive model is designed to give a rating no less then .1 ""Somewhat limiting"".  Extreme care and caution should be used around cutbanks to protect from cave in injury or death.  Cutbanks caving can also reduce the life expectancy of the pond unless practices are applied to limit slumping once the reservoir is filled.

"WMS - Pond Reservoir Area"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""WMS - Pond Reservoir Area"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

A pond reservoir area is an area that holds water behind a dam or embankment.  Livestock or wildlife watering facilities are examples of the potential application of pond reservoir areas.

Soil properties influence development of pond reservoir areas including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for pond reservoir areas are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The soils best suited to this use have a low seepage potential, which is determined by permeability and depth to fractured or permeable bedrock, to a cemented pan, or to other permeable material.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.  Suitable sites may be difficult to find on slopes steeper than about 10 percent.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Seepage:  The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is unimpeded and seepage may become a performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum Ksat between a depth of 50 to 180 cm.
	
	Property used: PERMEABILITY MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 50-180cm (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	 > 14.0 micrometers/sec
		Somewhat Limiting 	=> 1.0 and <= 14.0 micrometers/sec
		Not limiting		 < 1.0 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	2.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits site preparation, reservoir depth, and pond maintenance. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Paralithic bedrock has less limitation then lithic and the rating is reduced by a power of 3.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.
