The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the ease of developing camp areas and the performance of the areas after development.  Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns affecting the development of camp areas.  The soil properties that affect the performance of the areas after development are those that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation, especially in heavily used areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of camp areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  The soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and large stones.  The soil properties that affect the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, Ksat, and toxic substances in the soil.

Sewage sludge is the residual product of the treatment of municipal sewage.  The solid component consists mainly of cell mass, primarily bacteria cells that developed during secondary treatment and have incorporated soluble organics into their own bodies.  The sludge has small amounts of sand, silt, and other solid debris.  The content of nitrogen varies.  Some sludge has constituents that are toxic to plants or hazardous to the food chain, such as heavy metals and exotic organic compounds, and should be analyzed chemically prior to use.

The content of water in the sludge ranges from about 98 percent to less than 40 percent.  The sludge is considered liquid if it is more than about 90 percent water, slurry if it is about 50 to 90 percent water, and solid if it is less than about 50 percent water.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, erodibility, the rate at which the sludge is applied, and the method by which the sludge is applied.  The properties that affect absorption, plant growth, and microbial activity include Ksat, depth to a water table, ponding, the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, available water capacity, reaction, salinity, and bulk density.  The wind erodibility group, the soil erodibility factor K, and slope are considered in estimating the likelihood that wind erosion or water erosion will transport the waste material from the application site.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of the system, and public health.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and flooding affect absorption of the effluent.  Stones and boulders, ice, and bedrock or a cemented pan interfere with installation.  Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas.

Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth of less than 4 feet below the distribution lines.

When these areas are reclaimed, layers of soil material or unconsolidated geological material, or both, are replaced in a vertical sequence.  The reconstructed soil favors plant growth.  The ratings do not apply to quarries and other mined areas that require an offsite source of reconstruction material.  The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect erosion and stability of the surface and the productive potential of the reconstructed soil.  These properties include the content of sodium, salts, and calcium carbonate; reaction; available water capacity; erodibility; texture; content of rock fragments; and content of organic matter and other features that affect fertility.

The soils are rated ""Good,"" ""Fair,"" or ""Poor"" as potential sources of reclamation material.  The ratings are based on the amount of suitable material and on soil properties that affect the ease of excavation and the performance of the material after it is in place.  The thickness of the suitable material is a major consideration.  The ease of excavation is affected by large stones, depth to a water table, and slope.  How well the soil performs in place after it has been compacted and drained is determined by its strength (as inferred from the AASHTO classification of the soil) and linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential).  Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of ""Good"" means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated ""Fair"" can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.

24|"Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Slow rate treatment of wastewater is a process in which wastewater is applied to land at a rate normally between 0.5 inch and 4.0 inches per week.  The application rate commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland.  The applied wastewater is treated as it moves through the soil.  Much of the treated water may percolate to the ground water, and some enters the atmosphere through evapotranspiration.  The applied water generally is not allowed to run off the surface.  Waterlogging is prevented either through control of the application rate or through the use of tile drains, or both.

Soil properties are important considerations in areas where soils are used as sites for the treatment and disposal of organic waste and wastewater.  Selection of soils with properties that favor waste management can help to prevent environmental damage.

Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste.  It may have received primary or secondary treatment.  It is rarely untreated sewage.  Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride.  The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste.  Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter.  The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste.  The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter.  When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, erodibility, and the application of waste.  The properties that affect absorption include the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a water table, ponding, available water capacity, Ksat, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, reaction, the cation-exchange capacity, and slope.  Reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density affect plant growth and microbial activity.  The wind erodibility group, the soil erodibility factor K, and slope are considered in estimating the likelihood of wind erosion or water erosion.  Stones, cobbles, a water table, ponding, and flooding can hinder the application of waste.  Permanently frozen soils are unsuitable for waste treatment.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the ease of developing picnic areas and that influence trafficability and the growth of vegetation after development.  Slope and stoniness are the main concerns affecting the development of picnic areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of picnic areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  The soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, Ksat, and large stones.  The soil properties that affect the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, Ksat, and toxic substances in the soil.

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the recreational uses.  ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.  Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.  ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.

29|"Manure and Food Processing Wastes"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"The application of manure and food-processing waste not only disposes of waste material but also can improve crop production by increasing the supply of nutrients in the soils where the material is applied.  Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry, and food-processing waste is damaged fruit and vegetables and the peelings, stems, leaves, pits, and soil particles removed in food preparation.  The manure and food-processing waste are solid, slurry, or liquid.  Their nitrogen content varies.  A high content of nitrogen limits the application rate.  Toxic or otherwise dangerous wastes, such as those mixed with the lye used in food processing, are not considered in the ratings.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, erodibility, the rate at which the waste is applied, and the method by which the waste is applied.  The properties that affect absorption include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and available water capacity.  The properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity include reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density.  The wind erodibility group, the soil erodibility factor K, and slope are considered in estimating the likelihood that wind erosion or water erosion will transport the waste material from the application site.  Stones, cobbles, a water table, ponding, and flooding can hinder the application of waste.  Permanently frozen soils are unsuitable for waste treatment.

Embankments that have zoned construction (core and shell) are not considered.  The soils are rated as a source of material for embankment fill.  The ratings apply to the soil material below the surface layer to a depth of about 5 feet.  It is assumed that soil layers will be uniformly mixed and compacted during construction.

The ratings do not indicate the suitability of the undisturbed soil for supporting the embankment.  Soil properties to a depth even greater than the height of the embankment can affect performance and safety of the embankment.  Generally, deeper onsite investigation is needed to determine these properties.

Soil material in embankments must be resistant to seepage, piping, and erosion and have favorable compaction characteristics.  Unfavorable features include less than 5 feet of suitable material and a high content of stones or boulders, organic matter, or salts or sodium.  A high water table affects the amount of usable material.  It also affects trafficability.

The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil from a source away from the site.  A final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill.  A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic, and involves a risk of ground-water pollution.  Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability and the risk of pollution.  These properties include flooding, Ksat, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan.  Flooding is a serious problem because it can result in pollution in areas downstream from the landfill.  If Ksat is too rapid or if fractured bedrock, a fractured cemented pan, or the water table is close to the surface, the leachate can contaminate the water supply.  Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads in the steeper areas of the landfill.  Also, leachate may flow along the surface of the soils in the steeper areas and cause difficult seepage problems.

64|"Overland Flow Process Treatment of Wastewater"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"In this process wastewater is applied to the upper reaches of sloped land and allowed to flow across vegetated surfaces, sometimes called terraces, to runoff-collection ditches.  The length of the run generally is 150 to 300 feet.  The application rate ranges from 2.5 to 16.0 inches per week.  It commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland.  The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients on the vegetated surfaces as it flows down slope in a thin film.  Most of the water reaches the collection ditch, some is lost through evapotranspiration, and a small amount may percolate to the ground water.

Wastewater includes municipal and food-processing wastewater and effluent from lagoons or storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste.  It may have received primary or secondary treatment.  It is rarely untreated sewage.  Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride.  The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste.  Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter.  The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste.  The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter.  When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

84|"Sewage Lagoons"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the solid and liquid wastes.  Lagoons should have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted soil.  Nearly impervious soil material for the lagoon floor and sides is required to minimize seepage and contamination of ground water.  Considered in the ratings are slope, Ksat, depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, large stones, and content of organic matter.

Ksat is a critical property affecting the suitability for sewage lagoons.  Most porous soils eventually become sealed when they are used as sites for sewage lagoons.  Until sealing occurs, however, the hazard of pollution is severe.  Soils that have a Ksat rate of more than 14 micrometers per second are too porous for the proper functioning of sewage lagoons.  In these soils, seepage of the effluent can result in contamination of the ground water.  Ground-water contamination is also a hazard if fractured bedrock is within a depth of 40 inches, if the water table is high enough to raise the level of sewage in the lagoon, or if floodwater overtops the lagoon.

A high content of organic matter is detrimental to proper functioning of the lagoon because it inhibits aerobic activity.  Slope, bedrock, and cemented pans can cause construction problems, and large stones can hinder compaction of the lagoon floor.  If the lagoon is to be uniformly deep throughout, the slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make land smoothing practical.

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses.  ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.  Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.  ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.

57|"Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Rapid infiltration of wastewater is a process in which wastewater applied in a level basin at a rate of 4 to 120 inches per week percolates through the soil.  The wastewater may eventually reach the ground water.  The application rate commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment; hence, the basins may or may not be vegetated.  The thickness of the soil material needed for proper treatment of the wastewater is more than 72 inches.  As a result, geologic and hydrologic investigation is needed to ensure proper design and performance and to determine the risk of ground-water pollution.

Soil properties are important considerations in areas where soils are used as sites for the treatment and disposal of organic waste and wastewater.  Selection of soils with properties that favor waste management can help to prevent environmental damage.

Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste.  It may have received primary or secondary treatment.  It is rarely untreated sewage.  Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride.  The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste.  Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter.  The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste.  The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter.  When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution and the design, construction, and performance of the system.  Depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan affect the risk of pollution and the design and construction of the system.  Slope, stones, and cobbles also affect design and construction.  Ksat and reaction affect performance.  Permanently frozen soils are unsuitable for waste treatment.

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect agricultural waste management.  ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.  Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.  ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.  ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use.

90|"Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"A ""trench sanitary landfill"" is an area where solid waste is placed in successive layers in an excavated trench.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil excavated at the site.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill.  A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic, and involves a risk of ground-water pollution.  Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution, the ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation.  These properties include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, flooding, texture, stones and boulders, highly organic layers, soil reaction, and content of salts and sodium.  Unless otherwise stated, the ratings apply only to that part of the soil within a depth of about 6 feet. For deeper trenches, onsite investigation may be needed.

Hard, nonrippable bedrock, creviced bedrock, or highly permeable strata in or directly below the proposed trench bottom can affect the ease of excavation and the hazard of ground-water pollution.  Slope affects construction of the trenches and the movement of surface water around the landfill.  It also affects the construction and performance of roads in areas of the landfill.

Soil texture and consistence affect the ease with which the trench is dug and the ease with which the soil can be used as daily or final cover.  They determine the workability of the soil when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and are difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.

The soil material used as the final cover for a trench landfill should be suitable for plants.  It should not have excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid.  The surface layer generally has the best workability, the highest content of organic matter, and the best potential for plants.  Material from the surface layer should be stockpiled for use as the final cover.

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses.  ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.  Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.  ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.

The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit.  When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.

The soil material is obtained offsite, transported to the landfill, and spread over the waste.  The ratings also apply to the final cover for a landfill.  They are based on the soil properties that affect workability, the ease of digging, and the ease of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during wet and dry periods.  These properties include soil texture, depth to a water table, ponding, rock fragments, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, reaction, and content of salts, sodium, or lime.

Loamy or silty soils that are free of large stones and excess gravel are the best cover for a landfill.  Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread; sandy soils are subject to wind erosion.

Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material.  Also, it can influence runoff, erosion, and reclamation of the borrow area. 

The soil material used as the final cover for a landfill should be suitable for plants.  It should not have excess sodium, salts, or lime and should not be too acid.  After soil material has been removed, the soil material remaining in the borrow area must be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table to permit revegetation.  However, some damage to the borrow area is expected and plant growth may not be optimum.

This information is intended for land use planning, for evaluating land use alternatives, and for planning site investigations prior to design and construction.

2|"Effective Cation Exchange Capacity (ECEC)"|"chorizon"|"ecec_r"|"Float"||1|"Effective cation-exchange capacity refers to the sum of extractable bases plus aluminum expressed in terms of milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil.  It is determined for soils that have pH of less than 5.5.  Soils having a low cation-exchange capacity (CEC) hold fewer cations and may require more frequent applications of fertilizer than soils having a high cation-exchange capacity.  The ability to retain cations reduces the hazard of ground-water pollution.  Effective CEC is a measure of CEC that is particularly useful in soils whose ion exchange capacity is largely a result of variable charge components such as allophane, kaolinite, hydrous iron and aluminum oxides, and organic matter, which results in soil's CEC being not a fixed number but a function of pH.

For each soil horizon or layer in the underlying database, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values.

16|"Map Unit Hydric Rating"|"component"|"hydricrating"|"Choice"|254||"This rating provides an indication of the proportion of the map unit that meets criteria for hydric soils.  Map units that are dominantly made up of hydric soils may have small areas, or inclusions, of nonhydric soils in the higher positions on the landform, and map units dominantly made up of nonhydric soils may have inclusions of hydric soils in the lower positions on the landform.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994).  These soils, under natural conditions, are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation.

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness.  In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed.  Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002).  These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands.  The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2003) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993).

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field.  These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils.  The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and others, 2002)."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"HydrcRatng"||||||||0|||||0|||1|0|0||1|8||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""8""><ColorRampType type=""0"" name=""Random""><Values min=""50"" max=""99"" /><Saturation min=""33"" max=""66"" /><Hue start=""0"" end=""360"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""All Hydric"" label=""All Hydric"" order=""1"" /><Labels value=""Partially Hydric"" label=""Partially Hydric"" order=""2"" /><Labels value=""Not Hydric"" label=""Not Hydric"" order=""3"" /><Labels value=""Unknown Hydric"" label=""Unknown Hydric"" order=""4"" /></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|03/15/2006 12:40:32|"Absence/Presence"||1

The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents.  Available yield data from nearby counties and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop.  Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

The estimated yields reflect the productive capacity of each soil for the selected crop.  Yields are likely to increase as new production technology is developed.  The productivity of a given soil compared with that of other soils, however, is not likely to change."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||1|||1|"NirrYldCo"||"cropname"|"Choice"|"Crop"|"yldunits"|"Choice"|"Yield Units"|0|||||0|||0|1|1||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|03/15/2006 12:40:32|"Weighted Average"||1

66|"Available Water Supply 0 to 100 cm"|"muaggatt"|"aws0100wta"|"Float"||2|"Available water supply (AWS) is the total volume of water (in centimeters) that should be available to plants if the soil, inclusive of fragments, were at field capacity.  It is commonly estimated as the amount of water held between field capacity and wilting point, with corrections for salinity, fragments, and rooting depth.  AWS is reported as a single value (centimeters) of water for the specified depth of soil.  AWS is calculated based on the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

For each soil horizon or layer in the underlying database, available water capacity, used in the computation of AWS, is actually recorded as three separate values.  A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the corresponding component.  A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the corresponding component.  For the derivation of AWS, only the representative available water capacity value is used.

Available water supply for each map unit component is computed as described above, and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit using the process described below.

A map unit is typically composed of one or more ""components.""  A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop.  For the attribute being aggregated (e.g. Available Water Supply), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components.  From this set of component attributes, the next step of the aggregation process derives a single value that represents the map unit as a whole.  Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for soil map units can be generated.  Aggregation must be done because, on any soil map, map units are delineated but components are not.

For each of a map unit's components, a corresponding percent composition is recorded.  A percent composition of 60 indicates that the corresponding component typically makes up approximately 60% of the map unit.

For available water supply, a weighted average of all component values is computed where percent composition is the weighting factor."|"centimeters"|"cm"|"Property"||||1|0|0|0||1|||1|"AWS100"||||||||0|||||0|||0|0|0||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|03/15/2006 12:40:32|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1

The four hydrologic soil groups are:

Group A.  Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet.  These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravelly sands.  These soils have a high rate of water transmission.

Group B.  Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet.  These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture.  These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.

Group C.  Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet.  These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture.  These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.

Group D.  Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet.  These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material.  These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission.

74|"Nonirrigated Capability Class"|"component"|"nirrcapcl"|"Choice"|254||"Land capability classification shows, in a general way, the suitability of soils for most kinds of field crops.  Crops that require special management are excluded.  The soils are grouped according to their limitations for field crops, the risk of damage if they are used for crops, and the way they respond to management.  The criteria used in grouping the soils do not include major and generally expensive landforming that would change slope, depth, or other characteristics of the soils, nor do they include possible but unlikely major reclamation projects.  Capability classification is not a substitute for interpretations that show suitability and limitations of groups of soils for rangeland, for woodland, and for engineering purposes.

In the capability system, soils are generally grouped at three levels -- capability class, subclass, and unit.  Only class and subclass are included in this dataset.

Capability classes, the broadest groups, are designated by the numbers 1 through 8.  The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower choices for practical use.  The classes are defined as follows:

Class 1 soils have few limitations that restrict their use.

Class 2 soils have moderate limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require moderate conservation practices.

Class 3 soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require special conservation practices, or both.

Class 4 soils have very severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require very careful management, or both.

Class 5 soils are subject to little or no erosion but have other limitations, impractical to remove, that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

Within these parameters tree/shrubs may be well or poorly suited because of climate, site and soil characteristics. Considering individual species performance under specified conditions of soil, climate, physiography, and management, groupings of species were developed. These groups are called Conservation Tree/Shrub Groups (CTSGs). Individual soils have been grouped with similar soils into one of the 10 main CTSGs. Most of these main groups are further divided into subgroups.

This information provides guidance for selecting species best suited within each of the groups of soils within each vegetative zone. It can also be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes and effectiveness for the purpose of the planting. It can be used to select plants for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should also be considered when recommending species, e.g. some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure conditions on individual sites are considered when selecting species suitability and performance. A case by case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG group is most appropriate when an individual site has different characteristics than the CTSG it is listed in.

The criteria used in grouping the soils do not include major and generally expensive landforming that would change slope, depth, or other characteristics of the soils, nor do they include possible but unlikely major reclamation projects.  Capability classification is not a substitute for interpretations that show suitability and limitations of groups of soils for rangeland, for woodland, and for engineering purposes.

In the capability system, soils are generally grouped at three levels -- capability class, subclass, and unit. Only class and subclass are included in this dataset.

Capability classes, the broadest groups, are designated by the numbers 1 through 8.  The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower choices for practical use.  The classes are defined as follows:

Class 2 soils have moderate limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require moderate conservation practices.

Class 3 soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require special conservation practices, or both.

Class 4 soils have very severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require very careful management, or both.

Class 5 soils are subject to little or no erosion but have other limitations, impractical to remove, that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

Class 6 soils have severe limitations that make them generally unsuitable for cultivation and that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

Class 7 soils have very severe limitations that make them unsuitable for cultivation and that restrict their use mainly to grazing, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

Class 8 soils and miscellaneous areas have limitations that preclude commercial plant production and that restrict their use to recreational purposes, wildlife habitat, watershed, or esthetic purposes."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0|"capability_class"|1|||1|"IrrCpCls"||||||||0|||||0|||0|0|0||1|7||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""7""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""1"" label=""Capability Class - I"" order=""1"" /><Labels value=""2"" label=""Capability Class - II"" order=""2"" /><Labels value=""3"" label=""Capability Class - III"" order=""3"" /><Labels value=""4"" label=""Capability Class - IV"" order=""4"" /><Labels value=""5"" label=""Capability Class - V"" order=""5"" /><Labels value=""6"" label=""Capability Class - VI"" order=""6"" /><Labels value=""7"" label=""Capability Class - VII"" order=""7"" /><Labels value=""8"" label=""Capability Class - VIII"" order=""8"" /></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|03/15/2006 12:40:32|"Dominant Condition"||1

It includes all vegetation, whether or not it is palatable to grazing animals.  It includes the current year's growth of leaves, twigs, and fruits of woody plants.  It does not include the increase in stem diameter of trees and shrubs.  It is expressed in pounds per acre of air-dry vegetation.  In an unfavorable year, growing conditions are well below average, generally because of low available soil moisture.  Yields are adjusted to a common percent of air-dry moisture content.

In areas that have similar climate and topography, differences in the kind and amount of vegetation produced on rangeland are closely related to the kind of soil.

97|"Available Water Supply 0 to 025 cm"|"muaggatt"|"aws025wta"|"Float"||2|"Available water supply (AWS) is the total volume of water (in centimeters) that should be available to plants if the soil, inclusive of fragments, were at field capacity.  It is commonly estimated as the amount of water held between field capacity and wilting point, with corrections for salinity, fragments, and rooting depth.  AWS is reported as a single value (centimeters) of water for the specified depth of soil.  AWS is calculated based on the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

For each soil horizon or layer in the underlying database, available water capacity, used in the computation of AWS, is actually recorded as three separate values.  A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the corresponding component.  A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the corresponding component.  For the derivation of AWS, only the representative available water capacity value is used.

Available water supply for each map unit component is computed as described above, and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit using the process described below.

A map unit is typically composed of one or more ""components.""  A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop.  For the attribute being aggregated (e.g. Available Water Supply), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components.  From this set of component attributes, the next step of the aggregation process derives a single value that represents the map unit as a whole.  Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for soil map units can be generated.  Aggregation must be done because, on any soil map, map units are delineated but components are not.

For each of a map unit's components, a corresponding percent composition is recorded.  A percent composition of 60 indicates that the corresponding component typically makes up approximately 60% of the map unit.

For available water supply, a weighted average of all component values is computed where percent composition is the weighting factor."|"centimeters"|"cm"|"Property"||||1|0|0|0||1|||1|"AWS025"||||||||0|||||0|||0|0|0||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|03/15/2006 12:40:32|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1
