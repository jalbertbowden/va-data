The term is applied to the entire soil profile not just the particle-size control section. In the context of how it is to be used for identifying a kind of restriction, it is root restrictive.  2) Stratified soil textures that differ significantly enough as to restrict the movement of water and air through the soil, or that provide an unfavorable root environment.  It is in all cases root restrictive."|"No"
