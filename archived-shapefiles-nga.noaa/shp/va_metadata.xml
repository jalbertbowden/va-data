<abstract>
This data contains a set of geodetic control stations
maintained by the National Geodetic Survey.
Each geodetic control station in this dataset
has either a precise Latitude/Longitude used
for horizontal control or a precise Orthometric Height
used for vertical control, or both.

The National Geodetic Survey (NGS) serves
as the Nation's depository for geodetic data. The NGS
distributes geodetic data worldwide to a variety of
users. These geodetic data include the final results
of geodetic surveys, software programs to format,
compute, verify, and adjust original survey
observations or to convert values from one geodetic
datum to another, and publications that describe how to
obtain and use Geodetic Data products and services.
</abstract>
<purpose>
Provide a base of reference for latitude, longitude and height
throughout the United States.

Horizontal control stations (those with precise Latitude, Longitude)
were established in accordance with FGDC publications
"Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Accuracy Standards"
and "Geometric Geodetic Accuracy Standards and Specifications for
Using GPS Relative Positioning Techniques"
The final Latitude, Longitude of these stations were determined
by a least squares adjustments of the horizontal observations.
Horizontal control station have Latitude, Longitudes displayed
to 5 places and are identified by attribute POS_SRCE = 'ADJUSTED'

Lesser quality Latitude, Longitudes may also be preset in the dataset.
These are identified by a POS_SRCE attributes
HD_HELD1, HD_HELD2, or SCALED.
These lesser quality positions are described at:
&lt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_lookup.prl?Item=SCALED&gt;

Vertical control stations (those with precise Orthometric Heights)
were established in accordance with FGDC publications
"Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Accuracy Standards"
The final Orthometric Height of these stations were in most cases
determined by a least squares adjustments of the vertical observations
but in some cases may have been keyed from old survey documents.
Vertical control stations have Orthometric Heights displayed
to 2 or 3 places and are identified by attribute ELEV_SRCE of
ADJUSTED, ADJ UNCH, POSTED,READJUST,N HEIGHT,RESET,COMPUTED

Lesser quality Orthometric Heights may also be preset in the dataset.
These are identified by a ELEV_SRCE attributes
GPS_OBS, VERT_ANG, H_LEVEL, VERTCON, SCALED.
These lesser quality orthometric heights are described at:
&lt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_lookup.prl?Item=SCALED&gt;

IMPORTANT - Control stations do not always have both precise
Latitude, Longitude AND precise Orthometric Height.
A horizontal control station may have a orthometric
height associated with it which is of non geodetic quality.
These types of heights are displayed to 0, 1, or 2 decimal
places.  Worst case being off by +/- 1 meter.
LIKEWISE - A Vertical control station may have a Latitude, Longitude
associated with it which is of non geodetic quality.
These types of Latitude, Longitudes are displayed to 0, 1 or 2 decimal
places.  Worst case being off by +/- 180 meter.
Refer to &lt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_lookup.prl?Item=SCALED&gt;
for a description of the various type of methods used in determining
the Latitude, Longitude, and Orthometric Height.

Attribute POS_CHECK and ELEV_CHECK indicate whether or not
an observational check was made to the position and/or orthometric height.
Care should be taken when using "No Check" coordinates.

If attribute ELEV_SRCE = 'VERTCON' then the Orthometric Height was
determined by applying NGS program VERTCON to an Old NGVD 29 height.
In most areas VERTCON gives results to +/- 2 cm.
See &lt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Vertcon/vertcon.html&gt; for a more
detailed explanation of VERTCON accuracy.

Ellipsoid Heights are also present in the dataset.
The ellipsoid heights consist of those determined using a precise
geoid model, which are displayed to 2 decimal places and are considered
good to +/- .005 meters, and those displayed to 1 decimal place and are considered
only good to +/- .5 meters

The National Geodetic Survey
produces geodetic data. Geodetic data comprise
the results of geodetic surveys to determine,
among other things, latitude, longitude, height,
scale, and orientation control. The National
Geodetic Survey original field survey project
observations and final reports are accessioned
into records system of the National Archives and
Records Administration of the U.S.A. These
surveys provide information valuable for a variety
of uses in the mapping, charting and surveying
community.

The NGS' final product is the geodetic data sheet.
Geodetic data sheets are comprehensive summaries
of all published information for a given
geodetic reference point, including:
the geographic position and/or height based on the
current reference datum, condition of the survey
mark when it was last visited, a description of
where the point is located and how to reach it,
and an explanation of the terms used in the data
sheet. In support of these geodetic data, the NGS
provides software, publications, and various user
services, including geodetic advisor program,
instrument calibration, surveying standards, and
technical workshops.

This dataset contains certain information extracted
from the above mentioned data sheet.

are defined in the Federal Geodetic Control
Committee publication "Standards and Specifications for Geodetic
Control Networks".  In addition-

Vertical control which were determined only for the purpose of
supplying a height for Horizontal Distance Reductions are
assigned an order of 3.

Class 0 is used for special cases of
orthometric vertical control as follows-

Vertical Order/Class               Tolerance Factor

to an old NGVD 29 height.
N=Orthometric Height determined by observations.
DIST_RATE-
Distribution rate for POSTED and READJUSTED benchmarks
which do not have an Order and Class are as follows
"Posted bench marks" are vertical control points in the NGS data
base which were excluded from the NAVD 88 general adjustment.
Some of the bench marks were excluded due to large adjustment
residuals, possibly caused by vertical movement of the bench marks
during the time interval between different leveling epochs.
Adjusted NAVD 88 are computed for posted bench marks by
supplemental adjustments.

A range of mean distribution rate corrections is listed for each
posted bench mark in the data portion of the publication.
A summary table of the mean distribution rates and their codes is
listed below.  The mean distribution rate corrections which were
applied to the original leveling observations is a good
indication of the usefulness of the posted bench marks' adjusted
NAVD 88 heights.

Distribution                     Distribution
Rate Code                      Rate Correction
------------                    ---------------
"a"                        0.0 thru 1.0 mm/km
"b"                        1.1 thru 2.0   "
"c"                        2.1 thru 3.0   "
"d"                        3.1 thru 4.0   "
"e"                        4.1 thru 8.0   "
"f"                        greater than 8.0 mm/km

POSTED BENCH MARKS SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.  As is the case for
all leveling projects, the mandatory FGCS check leveling two-mark or
three-mark tie procedure will usually detect any isolated movement
(or other problem) at an individual bench mark.  Of course, regional
movement affecting all the marks equally is not detected by the two-
or three-mark tie procedure.

ELLP_ORDER-
Order of accuracy for the ELLIP_HT
Should be 1,2,3,4, or 5 if present.

The following ellipsoid height order and class relative accuracy
standards have not yet been adopted by the Federal Geodetic
Control Subcommittee, but are currently in use by NGS-

Ellipsoid Height                    Maximum Height
Classification                   Difference Accuracy
------------------                 -------------------
1      class 1                  0.5 (mm)/sqrt(km)
1      class 2                  0.7
2     class 1                  1.0
2     class 2                  1.3
3      class 1                  2.0
3      class 2                  3.0
4     class 1                  6.0
4     class 2                 15.0
5      class 1                 30.0
5      class 2                 60.0

The ellipsoid height difference accuracy (b) is computed from a
a minimally constrained correctly weighted least squares adjustment
by-
b = s / sqrt(d)

where
b = height difference accuracy
s = propagated standard deviation of ellipsoid height
difference in millimeters between control points
obtained from the least squares adjustment.
d = horizontal distance between control points in kilometers
